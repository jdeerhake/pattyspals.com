		<h2>About Patty's Pals</h2>
		<p>Patty's Pals is a group that has come together to assist a wonderful person in great need. Many of us are critical care nurses, some are not, however, all of us share the common goal of helping our friend Patty deal with cancer. It occurred to us that, collectively, we have helped thousands of people through all sorts of acute health care crises and now we have a chance to help one of our own.</p>
		<p>Our goal is to raise funds for Patty through positive events that bring caring people together. She is a person who values independence and wisdom. We hope to assist her in maintaining these values throughout her course of cancer treatment.</p>
