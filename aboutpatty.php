		<h2>About Patty</h2>
		<img src="images/photos/pattyisiah.jpg" alt="Patty and Isiah" class="floatRight" />
		<p>Patty was a 43 year old single mother of 4 who was diagnosed in May 2010 with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer with metastasis to the liver. She was a dedicated ICU nurse who cared for thousands of critically ill patients and saved many lives. Patty's last nursing role included being a member of the Rapid Response Team, allowing her to put mind, body and soul into the immediate resuscitation efforts of many acute patients. Patty always felt that it was quite ironic that she required others to assist in her care, knowing that this was a place no nurse ever wishes to be. Sadly, but comfortably, Patty died on November 9, 2011.</p>
