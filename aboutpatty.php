		<h2>About Patty</h2>
		<img src="images/photos/pattyisiah.jpg" alt="Patty and Isiah" class="floatRight" />
		<p>Patty is a 43 year old single mother of 4 that was diagnosed in May 2010 with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer with metastasis to the liver. She is a dedicated ICU nurse who has cared for thousands of critically ill patients and saved many lives. Most recently, her current position includes being a member of the Rapid Response Team. This role has allowed Patty to put mind, body and soul into the immediate resuscitation efforts of many acute patients. It is quite ironic that now, she requires others to assist in her care, a place no nurse ever wishes to be.</p>
